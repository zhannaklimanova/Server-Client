# Server-Client

Server is generating and sending out some data to the client. Client is outputting received data in the console. 
Client is also sending out data to server. Server is receiving the data and writing it into a text file. 
PlotData.py is used to graph the contents of the text file using MatPlotLib (x-axis is time; y-axis is data values).
